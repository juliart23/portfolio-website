    <h1>About</h1>
    <div>
      <p> I’m Julianna (Jules) -- a graphic designer, aspiring vegetable-gardener, wanna-be gourmet cook, loving wife, and super-mom of two amazing little boys.</p>
      <p>My designs have been key components of campaigns that have helped companies grow into the tens of millions, and dominate their respective space in print design, direct mail and digital formats.</p>
      <p>I have designed materials for one of the fastest growing direct marketing companies in the nation, (mentioned in Fortune numerous times) specializing in the survival and health markets, as well as nationally known TV personalities to support their charitable endeavors, among other fun projects.</p>
      <p>I am confident in my skills as an artist, yet collaborate well with other creatives and professionals to bring all marketing campaigns to life and make them highly effective. I always seek to strike the right balance between an eye-catching aesthetic, and proven design principles that are known to convert.</p>
